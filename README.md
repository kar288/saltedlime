# Portfolio and other applications

This github repository contains all code related to my [portfolio](http://www.carmelaacevedo.com).

There are several other applications and projects that are bundled into this repository.

## Resume

The HTML version of my resume is built using paper components.

## Photography

Is a simple page with a bit of javascript to showcase some of my photographic projects.

## Recipes

Is the project I am currently working on. It is a django application to organize and keep track of recipes. I am trying to build it with as little javascript as possible (although materializecss already has a lot).
